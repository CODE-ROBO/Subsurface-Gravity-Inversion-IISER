### <a id="overview"></a>🌐 EXECUTIVE RESEARCH OVERVIEW

<div align="justify">
This repository serves as the central deployment hub for the computational workflows, data preprocessing pipelines, and algorithmic models developed during my research internship at the <b>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune</b>. 

The core research focuses on leveraging stochastic Machine Learning (ML) frameworks to enhance, segment, and analyze high-resolution imaging datasets. By replacing traditional deterministic filtering with deep-learning-based feature extraction, this project closes the loop between advanced computational intelligence and rigorous scientific visualization, isolating critical micro-structural regions of interest (ROIs) with high dimensional accuracy.

### <a id="logic"></a>🧪 ALGORITHMIC ARCHITECTURE & COMPUTER VISION

<div align="justify">
To accurately isolate features from high-noise scientific imaging, the system relies on deep convolutional architectures. The foundational feature extraction occurs via 2D spatial convolution, where the image matrix (I) is processed by a learned kernel (K) to produce a feature map (S):

S(i, j) = Σ_m Σ_n I(m, n) K(i-m, j-n)

To evaluate the precision of the micro-structural segmentation, the models are benchmarked using the Sørensen–Dice coefficient (Dice Loss) to maximize the overlap between the algorithmic prediction (p) and the scientific ground truth (g):

L_Dice = 1 - (2 * Σ p_i g_i) / (Σ p_i^2 + Σ g_i^2)

By minimizing this loss function during the training loop, the architecture learns to aggressively filter ambient visual noise while maintaining the structural fidelity of the target ROIs.
